    Attributes:
        numPoints_ (int): Number of points that will be sampled from each model. If 0, all the
            points of each model are used.
        ptDropOut_ (float): Probability to keep a point during uniform sampling when all the points
                or only the first n number of points are selected.
        pointFeatures_ (bool): Boolean that indicates if the models contain point features. If not,
            only one feature will be generated for each point with value equal to 1.0.
        pointLabels_ (bool): Boolean that indicates if the models contain point labels.
        pointNormals_ (bool): Boolean that indicates if the models contain point normals. If not,
            sampling protocols lambert and occlusion cannot be used.
        useCategories_ (bool): Boolean that indicates if there dataset contains categories for each model.
            If True, the class will generate a list with an integer per each model in the batch.
        pointCategories_ (bool): Boolean that indicates if the category of the model should be provided
            for each point indepently. If True, instead of providing a list with an integer per each
            model in the dataset, a list with the category of the model for each point will be generated.
        batchSize_ (int): Size of the batch used.
        allowedSamplings_ (array of ints): Each element of the array determines an allowed sampling protocol
            that will be used to sample the different models. The implemented sampling protocols are:
            - 0: Uniform sampling
            - 1: Split sampling
            - 2: Gradient sampling
            - 3: Lambert sampling
            - 4: Occlusion sampling
        maxNumPtsCache_ (int): Maximum number of points that can be stored in the cache.
        maxPtsxBatch_ (int): Maximum number of points per batch. If 0, each batch will contain batchSize
            number of models. If greater than 0, the batch will contain a maximum number of models equal
            to batchSize or a maximum number of point equal to maxPtsxBatch.
        augment_ (bool): Boolean that indicates if data augmentation will be used in the models.
        augmentMainAxis_ (int): Indexs of the axis used to rotate the models when data augmentation is
            active. Possible values (0, 1, 2).
        augmentSmallRotations_ (bool): Boolean that indicates if small rotations alogn every axis will be used
            when data augmentation is active.
        uniformSelectFirst_ (bool): Boolean that indicates if the first n points will be selected from the list
            in the uniform sampling protocol, or a random selection of n points will be used instead.
        augmentedFeatures_ (array of ints): Each element of the list points to the first element of groups of
            3 features that will also processed by the data augmentation. Example: the value 2 in the list will
            indicate that features f[2:5] will be treated as a vector an rotated by the data augmentation algorithm.
            This feature will allow to use data augmentation when vectors are provided as features to the networks
            (normals, tangent space, velocity, etc.).
        augmentedLabels_ (array of ints): The same as augmentedFeatures_, but for labels.
        fileList_ (array of strings): List of paths of the models of the dataset.
        numPts_ (array of ints): List of number of points of each model of the dataset.
        categories_ (array of ints): List of categories of each model of the dataset. If the dataset does not contain
            category information, the list is empty.
        cacheCurrNumPts (int): Number of points stored in the cache.
        cacheAddedOrder_ (deque of strings): List of last accessed models. The first element of the queue was the last
            queried model.
        ptsCache_ (dict of arrays): Cache of point lists.
        normalsCache_ (dict of arrays): Cache of normals lists.
        featureCache_ (dict of arrays): Cache of feature lists.
        labelsCache_ (dict of arrays): Cache of labels lists.
        randomSelection_ (array of ints): Permutated indexs of the models of the dataset.
        iterator_ (int): Iterator pointing at the next model to process in the randomSelection_ list.
        randomState_ (random state): Numpy random state used to generate random numbers.
